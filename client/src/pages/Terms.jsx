          </p>

          <h3>6. Privacy and Data Handling</h3>

            These Terms may be modified or updated at any time to reflect
            changes in the project’s scope, user feedback, or legal
            requirements. Users will be notified of significant updates through
            in-site announcements or email if provided. Continued use of the
            Site after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

            In the event that the University of the People formally recognizes

            terms or adjustments may be applied to reflect that recognition,
            including but not limited to content moderation, institutional data
            handling standards, and policy integration. Such changes will be
            communicated transparently and will supersede any prior terms where
            applicable.

          <h3>11. Termination</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the Site at
            any time, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates
            these Terms or is otherwise harmful to the platform or its users.
          </p>

          <h3>12. Governing Law</h3>
          <p>
